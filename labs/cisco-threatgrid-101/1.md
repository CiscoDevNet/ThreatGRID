## Learning Objective
After completing this module you will have basic understanding of Cisco threatGrid platform.


## What is Cisco threatGrid?
Cisco ThreatGRID is the first scalable, unified malware analysis and threat intelligence solution.

ThreatGRID enables a customer to upload a sample through our portal or via our *API*. We then do our proprietary analysis of the sample– an automated process that allows for a large volume of samples to be analyzed  quickly. We take an outside-in approach to analysis –at large scale and volume – and the end result is enriched content, for both the security analysts as well as the engineering teams to incorporate the threat intelligence into their security infrastructure.

1. Submission
Analyst or system (API) submits suspicious sample to ThreatGRID.
2. Enriched Content Integration
Actionable threat content and intelligence is generated that can be packaged and integrated in to a variety of existing systems or used independently.
3. Correlation at Unprecedented Scale
ThreatGRID platform correlates the sample result with millions of other samples / billions of artifacts.
4. Proprietary Analysis
An automated engine observes, deconstructs, and analyzes using multiple techniques.

## Interesting... I need more on threatGrid
ThreatGRID developed The First Unified Malware Analysis & Threat Intelligence Solution. The idea behind ThreatGRID was to provide a unified analysis platform or engine that can leverage multiple capabilities and multiple infrastructures within your organization to really unify them -- to provide a common analysis to those security technologies and provide rich content results with context enabling security teams to recover faster and to fully understand the malicious nature of a malware sample—what it’s doing, how can you better protect yourself against it and how can you recover form it, how can your better investigate a potential incident.
