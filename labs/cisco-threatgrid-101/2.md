## Tell me more about threatGrid APIs
Cisco ThreatGRID provides superb integration and automation to enable customers to provide detection and protection at scale--- it automates the whole process of sample *submission* and collection of *results*, *reports* and even JSON files back to the endpoints or network monitoring tools or even feeding the information to IDSs, proxies, and a variety of SIEMs, and visualization tools including Splunk, Maltego or even Palantir.

This is enabled via the 2-way *REST API* provided by Cisco ThreatGRID. We work with a number of different security product types – including host products, IDS/IPS, AV, network proxies and gateways, etc.

The idea is to leverage the data you are producing and correlating it with the global data that we process – all in an effort to compress the reaction time for the SOC team, to increase the accuracy and capability of the forensics team, and to enable engineering groups to automate and proactively block threats – and that is what we mean by a unified approach to malware analysis and threat intelligence which is what really differentiates Cisco threatGrid.
