## What is Threat Grid Consumption Model?
Cisco Threat Grid is integrated as the anlaysis backend of many Cisco and thrid party products. Usage of THreat Grid may be included in the price of those products, or may be an add-on subscription option. Threat Grid as a standalone product has an annual subscription cost which is based on a variety of factors including number of seats, volume of samples analyzed, and other factors. Additionally, Threat Grid is available as an appliance, for onsite analysis of customer files.

## Tell me more about Threat Grid APIs
Cisco Threat Grid provides superb integration and automation to enable customers to provide detection and protection at scale--- it automates the whole process of sample *submission* and collection of *results*, *reports* and even JSON files back to the endpoints or network monitoring tools or even feeding the information to IDSs, proxies, and a variety of SIEMs, and visualization tools including Splunk, Maltego or even Palantir.

This is enabled via the 2-way *REST API* provided by Cisco Threat Grid. We work with a number of different security product types – including host products, IDS/IPS, AV, network proxies and gateways, etc.

The idea is to leverage the data you are producing and correlating it with the global data that we process – all in an effort to compress the reaction time for the SOC team, to increase the accuracy and capability of the forensics team, and to enable engineering groups to automate and proactively block threats – and that is what we mean by a unified approach to malware analysis and threat intelligence which is what really differentiates Cisco Threat Grid.
