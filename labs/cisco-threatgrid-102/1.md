## Introduction to Threat Intelligence (TI) and TI Use Cases
Everyone has heard a lot about Threat Intelligence, often from somebody trying
to sell them some. Threat Intelligence is evidentiary information about a threat
that can help protect against it in some way â€“ whether that is to block it
entirely, mitigate the risk, identify its perpetrator, or even just to detect
it. In the context of cyber threat intelligence, it is usually things like lists
of indicators of compromise, or known bad actors, etc.

Common use cases for TI include:

-   Preventative measures (eg block known bad guy)

-   Attack detection (eg wait, why is the secretary network talking to known bad
    guy)

-   Incident response (how about now we block known bad guy)

-   Adversary identification (who is this bad guy)
