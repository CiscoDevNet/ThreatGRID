## Conclusion

In this lab, we have explored some of the threat intelligence features of the Threat Grid API. We have reviewed the three main feed types and achieved an understanding of the contents and options for each.

- Curated data
- IoC data
- Sample data

We have used the browser and Postman to explore the API and familiarize itself with its basic functions and operation.
We have seen, modified, used, and written Python scripts to retrieve data in a usable and automatable fashion. 

We have discussed real life operationalization opportunities for this data, and how they contribute to standard SOC goals. 

I hope this lab has given you reason to agree with our Key Message from the beginning: 

> Retrieving Threat Intelligence from the Threat Grid API is both easy and beneficial.

Thank you for your interest in Threat Grid.
