## Introduction to threatGrid APIs
The Threat Grid API collection allows you, among many other things, to retrieve
this information.

API Endpoints in bold will be touched on in this session.

### Available APIs

-   User mgmt API (v3) */users/*

    -   Create users, set sample limits, etc

-   Data API (v2)

    -   search /search/

        -   search observables and samples by specific criteria

    -   sample mgmt: */samples/*

        -   submit

        -   retrieve data/analysis

        -   raw observables feeds **/samples/feeds/**

            -   Get lists of observables associated with a filterable set of
                samples

            -   Harvested from all sample activity

            -   \^ Therefore high FP

            -   Can filter to your user’s or your org’s samples only; eg “get
                all domains associated with samples my company submitted”

            -   Results in JSON

    -   IOC feeds **/iocs/feeds**

        -   Observables seen in conjunction with Behaviour Indicators

        -   Moderate FP level

        -   Only those observables seen with a BI so there is at least some
            degree of suspicious behavior associated with the item

        -   Also filterable to only your or your org’s samples

        -   Results in JSON

-   Curated feeds API (v3) */feeds/*

    -   Based on specific, high confidence human-curated BIs

    -   Whitelisted via TG and Talos intelligence

    -   Much lower FP

    -   Groups observables by IOC type (eg “DGA DNS domains”)

    -   Not filterable by sample ownership – But you could combine with IOC
        feeds to get that!

    -   Least complex request structure

    -   Made for integrations - available output formats:

        -   JSON

        -   CSV

        -   Snort

        -   STIXBasics of API usage
