## Basics of API usage
### Threat Grid API Call construction:

-   Root:
    [https://panacea.threatgrid.com/api/v[23]/](https://panacea.threatgrid.com/api/v%5b23%5d/)
    (one of “v2” or “v3”)

-   API call (rest of path)

-   Parameters (query string)

    -   API key: from account details page

### Threat Grid API Responses

-   JSON format, plus other options for curated feeds

-   Not always lightning fast – code in timeouts for queries covering long
    periods or older records

\* The factual FP rate is 0; these were all seen. The functional FP rate, as an
indicator of local compromise, is dependent on the details of the observation
and varies from feed to feed.

\*\* additional formats not available for all curated feeds

Since the curated feeds are the easiest to immediately operationalize, we will
start there.
