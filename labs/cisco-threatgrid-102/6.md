>## &#128161; Hint:
>
> Threat Grid is very picky about the date formats. If you are having problems with IOC or Sample feeds and the request specifies dates, check the format and make sure they are in the following [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) compliant format: 
>
>*2018-01-15T09:00:00z*

In the sample feeds, as in the IOC feeds, parameters other than the feedname are passed as
regular HTTP parameters in the query string.
