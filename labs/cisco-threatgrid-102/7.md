## Retrieving data via the API


### Browser
Most API calls can be made directly from the location entry bar in your browser.
If you already have an ongoing authenticated session, you don’t even need to
include the API key. Construct the query as per the documentation, and you will
see the results in the browser. This is an easy way to confirm proper syntax or
get quick information.

Try it now: click or paste the following into your browser, either after logging
into the UI with your usual credentials, or by adding your API key at the end as
per the second example:

If already logged in:

<https://panacea.threatgrid.com/api/v2/iocs/feeds/domains?after=2018-01-08T21:39:13Z&before=2018-01-08T22:39:13Z>

Using API key:

<https://panacea.threatgrid.com/api/v2/iocs/feeds/domains?after=2018-01-08T21%3A39%3A13Z&before=2018-01-08T22:39:13Z&api_key=REPLACE-WITH-API-KEY>

**Congratulations – you just used the Threat Grid API to fetch threat
intelligence.**

Let’s break apart what you did there:

| Root                                  | Endpoint            | Parameters                                               |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| https://panacea.threatgrid.com/api/v2 | /iocs/feeds/domains | ?after=2018-01-08T21:39:13Z &before=2018-01-08T22:39:13Z |

You requested a feature of v2 API, namely the domains IOC feed, and passed it a
pair of dates (and perhaps your API key).

### Postman

Postman https://www.getpostman.com/ is a useful, graphical tool for breaking those parameters down more
intuitively. In Postman, you can specify individual parameter names and values
on a line by line basis, and the tool concatenates them in the query string
portion of the URL.

Unlike your browser, Postman can also transact via multiple HTTP methods such as
PUT, POST, even DELETE and many others. Postman can be helpful when you are
troubleshooting a call that didn’t work in the browser, or when you are
constructing a complex request, or when the endpoint or desired endpoint action
is only available via methods other than GET. Of course, it does not monitor
active browser sessions so you will always need the parameter for your API key.

Open up Postman, and make sure GET is selected in the left dropdown. Enter the
root and the endpoint from the previous exercise, and then click “Params” on the
right. Enter the ‘after’ and ‘before’ parameters and your ‘api\_key’ into rows
in the params box as shown below.

Experiment a bit with the different feeds and feed options to see how Postman
constructs the request for you and gives you response status and timing
feedback.

Of course, the main purpose of the API is to allow other programs to access

Usage examples
--------------

\*\*\*TODO\*\*\*

-   Snort output – obvious

-   Looking for evidence of infections (alert)

-   Looking for evidence of infections by malware that you know has already
    targeted your org (block)

-   Import into Splunk ES or other SIEM product

-   Import into Cisco Threat Intelligence Director (CTID)
