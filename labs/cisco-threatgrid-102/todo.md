# TODO list
All these things should either be done, or accepted to not be done, before the lab is published to prod.

## Fix image links
Use links that work in GitHub, so I can see what I am doing. In the likely event that other final paths need to be specififed, put them as comments for now and then switch to them before the final release and prod pub

## More excercise icons/callouts

## scripting section
### show example script
walk through main sections of the big script
link to my github? (TGIFF.py) - new CL repo? bgreenba@cisco
### excercise for them to write their own
simplified ver of TGIFF as hints.py

## Stronger finish re operationalizing
Need a more robust list of potential use cases and problems solved by the convered materials
go over initial TI use cases list in early slides and show how they all can be solved by what was covered, and where to go from here for more utility (eg TTP= file path searches etc)
