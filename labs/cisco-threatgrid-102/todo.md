# TODO list
All these things should either be done, or accepted to not be done, before the lab is published to prod.

## Fix image links
Use links that work in GitHub, so I can see what I am doing. In the likely event that other final paths need to be specififed, put them as comments for now and then switch to them before the final release and prod pub
