# TODO list
All these things should either be done, or accepted to not be done, before the lab is published to prod.

## Fix image links
Use links that work in GitHub, so I can see what I am doing. In the likely event that other final paths need to be specififed, put them as comments for now and then switch to them before the final release and prod pub


## Stronger finish re operationalizing
Need a more robust list of potential use cases and problems solved by the convered materials
go over initial TI use cases list in early slides and show how they all can be solved by what was covered, and where to go from here for more utility (eg TTP= file path searches etc)
