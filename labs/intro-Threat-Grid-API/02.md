## Introduction to Threat Grid APIs
The Threat Grid API collection allows you, among many other things, to retrieve this information.

API Endpoints in **bold** will be touched on in this session.

### Available APIs

-   User mgmt API (v3): */users/*
    -   Create users, set sample limits, etc

-   Data API (v2)
    -   Entity search */search/*
        -   search observables by specific criteria
    -   Entity lookups */domains/*, */urls/*, */paths/*, etc
        -   pivot from a known observable to other related information in Threat Grid data
    -   sample mgmt: */samples/*
        -   submit
        -   retrieve data/analysis
        -   raw observables feeds ***/samples/feeds/***
            -   Get lists of observables associated with a filterable set of samples
            -   Harvested from all sample activity, suspicious or not
            -   \^ Therefore high FP
            -   Can filter to your user’s or your org’s samples only; eg “get all domains associated with samples my company submitted”
            -   Results in JSON

    -   IOC feeds ***/iocs/feeds***
        -   Observables seen in conjunction with Behaviour Indicators
        -   Moderate FP level
        -   Only those observables seen with a BI so there is at least some degree of suspicious behavior associated with the item
        -   Also filterable to only your or your org’s samples
        -   Results in JSON

-   Curated feeds API (v3) ***/feeds/***
    -   Based on specific, high confidence human-curated BIs
    -   Whitelisted via TG and Talos intelligence
    -   Much lower FP
    -   Groups observables by IOC type (eg “DGA DNS domains”)
    -   Not filterable by sample ownership – But you could combine with IOC feeds to get that!
    -   Least complex request structure
    -   Made for integrations - available output formats:
        -   JSON
        -   CSV
        -   Snort
        -   STIX
