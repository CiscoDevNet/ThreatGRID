## Retrieving data via the API


### Browser
Most API calls can be made directly from the location entry bar in your browser.
If you already have an ongoing authenticated session, you don’t even need to
include the API key. Construct the query as per the documentation, and you will
see the results in the browser. This is an easy way to confirm proper syntax or
get quick information.

**Congratulations – you just used the Threat Grid API to fetch threat intelligence.**

Let’s break apart what you did there:

| Root                                  | Endpoint            | Parameters                                               |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ht<i></i>tps://panacea.threatgrid.com/api/v2 | /iocs/feeds/domains | ?after=2018-01-08T21:39:13Z <br>&before=2018-01-08T22:39:13Z |

You requested a feature of the v2 API, namely the domains IOC feed, and passed it a
pair of dates (and perhaps your API key).

### Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a useful, graphical tool for breaking those parameters down more intuitively. In Postman, you can specify individual parameter names and values on a line by line basis, and the tool concatenates them in the query string
portion of the URL.

Unlike your browser, Postman can also transact via multiple HTTP methods such as
PUT, POST, even DELETE and many others. Postman can be helpful when you are
troubleshooting a call that didn’t work in the browser, or when you are
constructing a complex request, or when the endpoint or desired endpoint action
is only available via methods other than GET. Of course, it does not monitor
active browser sessions - so you will always need the parameter for your API key.

### Python

Of course, the main purpose of the API is to allow other programs to access
Threat Grid. We will revisit this after a look at the available feeds and options.
