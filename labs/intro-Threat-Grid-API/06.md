## IOC Feeds

IOC feeds are lists of paths, artifact checksums, urls, IPs, registry keys, etc. which have been associated with an IOC.

### Menu of available feeds:

|Feedname|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|ips|all IP addresses seen in conjuction with triggered Behavior Indicators|
|domains|all domains seen in conjuction with triggered Behavior Indicators|
|urls|all urls seen in conjuction with triggered Behavior Indicators|
|artifacts|all artifacts seen in conjuction with triggered Behavior Indicators|
|paths|all file paths seen in conjuction with triggered Behavior Indicators|
|network_streams|all network streams seen in conjuction with triggered Behavior Indicators|
|registry_keys|all registry keys seen in conjuction with triggered Behavior Indicators|

### Call Parameters:
Commonly available parameters are listed in the following table. Some of the feeds also have additional available parameters; consult the documentation in the Threat Grid UI for more information.

| **confidence**         | Restrict to IOCs with this confidence score or higher, defaults to 80                   |
| **severity**           | Restrict to IOCs with this severity score or higher, defaults to 80                     |
| **ioc**                | Restrict returned records to events of this type                                        |

| **user\_only**         | If "true", will only match against samples you submitted                                |
| **sample**             | A comma-separated list of sample IDs. Restrict results to these samples.                |
| **limit**              | A limit of results per page of returns (default is between 1000 and 100,000 depending on feed)|
| **offset**             | How many records to skip from the beginning (how to get to page 2+ as per the above)    |

>## &#128161; Hint:
>
> Threat Grid is very picky about the date formats. If you are having problems with IOC or Sample feeds and the request specifies dates, check the format and make sure they are in the following [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) compliant format: 
>
>*2018-01-15T09:00:00z*

In the IOC (and sample) feeds, parameters other than the feedname are passed as regular HTTP parameters in the query string.

> Using either your browser or Postman, construct and send a query that will return all of the IP addresses seen in conjunction with IoCs during analysis of your organization's samples in the last week. Observe the results.
> What would such a list be useful for?
