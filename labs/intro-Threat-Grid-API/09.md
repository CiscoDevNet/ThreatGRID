## Usage examples

Early in this lab, we discussed some common SOC goals, and how threat intelligence can assist. This table lays out those goals again, and provides an example of Threat Grid data that could be used to meet each.

|Goal|Threat Grid data use case|
|-|-|
|Prevention| Download and block known bad, high confidence, IPs Domains, file hashes, etc that were seen in conjunction with samples your organization submitted \*|
|Detection| Alert on any of the above that have lower confidences and/or relevance|
|Response| Post malware incident, search for internal logs of any sighting of observables associated with the malware - and block going forward \*|
|TTP Identification| Search for commonalities in targeted data such as repeated file hashes or names, or network infrastructure|
|Attribution| If TTPs have been identified, those TTPs probably predate the attack on your organization. Attacker attribution is often based on the traces they leave behind.

> \* - after sufficient testing, and organization-specific whitelisting of critical business partners, of course.

Here are some examples of low investment methods to integrate the data into existing SOC processes:

-   Snort output for curated feeds - immediately operationalize network communication data as Snort rules

-   Import into Splunk ES or other SIEM product
    - Splunk lookup tables are simple CSV
      - Alerting on Threat Intelligence matches already in place in Splunk Enterprise Security
    - STIX format for curated feeds is now supported by many vendors
    
-   Import into Cisco Threat Intelligence Director (CTID)
    - Built into Firepower devices
    
-   If you already have a local threat intelligence repository / Threat Intelligence Management Platform (TIMP) set up an import for Threat Grid data.
