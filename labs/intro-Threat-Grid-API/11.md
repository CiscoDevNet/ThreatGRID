This was only a brief introduction to the capabilities of the Threat Grid API. We only talked about retreiving threat intelligence in bulk and some limited targeting and tailoring thereof. The API allows much more than that to be done in a programmatic fashion. The following are some resources to reference, both for more information about the content of this course and the capabilities that we did not cover at all. 

### Threat Grid Help Documentation

The built in Threat Grid documentation about the APIs is very robust and goes into much more detail that what was presented in this introductory course.
